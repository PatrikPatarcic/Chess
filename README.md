Hello, thank you for reading this.
This is an chess project made by a young student. Do not question his sanity.

This project is being done in VisualStudio 2020. I divided the project into two parts, UI and Logic. For Logic I used Class Library, and WPF application for UI (I am not using Windows Forms since it's harder to work with and it is outdated). I also made hand-made pieces and board, which I will hopefully redesing, beacuse it looks like shit.
